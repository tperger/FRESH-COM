## Overview on the method

The framework of the modeling approach is a peer-to-peer electricity trading concept in a local energy community. Prosumers (or consumers or producers) join on a voluntary basis and exchange PV electricity generated by community members with one another. The figure below presents the basic idea of the peer-to-peer trading concept in this paper. All members are connected to the public distribution grid to be able to cover the community's residual load, to feed in the surplus PV electricity, and to trade with the other community members (green arrows). Participants in the community are either households or small-to-medium-sized enterprises. The technology portfolio includes PV systems and battery energy storage systems (BESSs). In addition, each prosumer has an individual willingness-to-pay for PV electricity generated by community members, which determines the allocation of the peer-to-peer trading.

The aim of this work is to optimize the dynamic participation of prosumers in an energy community; hence, changes in the set-up of members over time (i.e., exit/entry). In the figure below, the orange parts represent a new member joining the community.
